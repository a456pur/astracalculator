        <h1>Scones | Method</h1>
        <p>Step 1: Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Sift self-raising flour into a large bowl.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Using your fingertips, rub butter into flour until mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Make a well in the centre. Add 1 cup of milk . Mix with a flat-bladed knife until mixture forms a soft dough, adding more milk if required. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently until smooth (don't knead dough too much or scones will be tough).</p>
        <p>Step 4: Lightly dust a flat baking tray with plain flour.</p>
        <p>Step 5: Pat dough into a 2cm-thick round. Using a 5cm (diameter) round cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Press dough together and cut out remaining 4 rounds. Place scones onto prepared baking tray, 1cm apart. Sprinkle tops with a little plain flour. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and well risen. Transfer to a wire rack. Serve warm with jam and cream.</p>
